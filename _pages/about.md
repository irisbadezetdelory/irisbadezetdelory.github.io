I am a student at the University of Chicago, studying physics and classics. My general interests lie at the intersection of climate, sustainability and their applications in different fields (tech, academic research, and finance). 
I am a research assistant in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics at UChicago under the supervision of Samuel Smith and Noboru Nakamura. I also interned at GFDL in Princeton during the summer between my sophomore and my junior year of college. 
Outside of classes you can find me with the Energy and Climate Club, the UChicago Sustainability dialogue (see my articles here!) or sailing.
